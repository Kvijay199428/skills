# Upgrade Plan — testing-audit-debugging-protocol (v2 Orchestrator)

## Goal

Extend the existing testing/audit/debugging skill into a full **Testing Audit Orchestrator**: a capability that can (a) **discover** the skills and tools available on a machine and in a project, (b) **register** them in a capability registry with metadata, (c) **select** the right instrument for each phase of an audit with a recorded, explainable reason, (d) **execute** those instruments under a read-only audit mode by default, (e) **remember** every selection and invocation in durable audit memory, (f) **correlate** findings into evidence-backed clusters, (g) build an **evidence graph** linking findings → evidence → skill/tool records → files, and (h) gate every change behind **dual approval gates** (Analysis Approval, then Code Modification Approval).

The core discipline of the original skill — **never silently turn discovery into a change** — is preserved and extended to skill/tool invocation, not just code edits. The orchestrator may discover, select, invoke, and coordinate skills and tools during read-only audit mode, but every selection must have an explainable reason, every invocation must produce an execution record, every finding must have evidence, every proposed modification must have a change budget, and **no implementation change may occur without explicit user approval.**

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The orchestrator operates as a **skill** (your own methodology) that sits **above** other skills and tools. It is not a replacement for them; it is the controller that decides which one fits a given audit question, calls it, records what it did, and reports the result through the same approval-gated pipeline used for code changes.

**Master rule (the user's exact new rule):**

> The orchestrator may discover, select, invoke, and coordinate skills and tools during read-only audit mode, but every selection must have an explainable reason, every invocation must produce an execution record, every finding must have evidence, every proposed modification must have a change budget, and no implementation change may occur without explicit user approval.

---

## 2. Operating Modes

The orchestrator moves through discrete modes. Each mode has a defined entry condition and a defined exit condition. Read-only modes require no approval; change modes require the corresponding approval gate.

| # | Mode | Purpose | Requires approval? | Exit condition |
|---|------|---------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **DISCOVERY** | Enumerate available global skills, project-local skills, and project tools; build the candidate inventory | No (read-only) | Capability shortlist assembled |
| 2 | **AUDIT (read-only, default)** | Understand the app, establish baseline, run existing tests, inspect — all non-mutating | No (read-only) | Findings documented with evidence |
| 3 | **SPECIALIST** | Delegate a sub-analysis to a selected skill/tool (read-only use of a specialist) | No if read-only | Execution record produced |
| 4 | **ROOT-CAUSE** | Analyze findings into root-cause hypotheses with confidence | No (read-only) | Findings classified CONFIRMED/LIKELY/SUSPECTED |
| 5 | **ANALYSIS APPROVAL** | User approves the analysis conclusions and the proposed fix *plan* (gate 1) | **Gate 1 yes** | Fix plan approved |
| 6 | **FIX** | Modify code with an approved skill/tool | **Gate 2 yes** | Change applied within budget |
| 7 | **VERIFICATION** | Re-test, regression, verification per the protocol | No (read-only) | Evidence of fix produced |
| 8 | **DEPLOY GATE** | Final readiness decision | No, but reported | Deployment STATUS delivered |

The two **approval gates** split what the original skill treated as a single "fix it" gate:

* **Gate 1 — Analysis Approval:** approve *what you concluded* (the fix plan: root cause, proposed fix, files, skill/tool selections, change budget) *before any plan is believed.* No code is touched.
* **Gate 2 — Code Modification Approval:** approve *actually running* the change (editing the named files, invoking the named change-making skill/tool) within the already-approved plan.

Both gates are explicit and separate. The same block may request both, but a user saying only "yes, your analysis is right" does **not** authorize code changes, and "yes, go ahead and fix it" presumes gate 1 was already granted.

---

## 3. Discovery Engine

Discovery is the read-only enumeration of what is available. It runs at task start and again at every AUDIT / SPECIALIST / FIX decision point in case new capabilities appeared.

### Discovery sources

1. **Global skills** — skills installed for the environment (e.g. the opencode `skills/` directory, a user-level skills repo). These are available to every project.
2. **Project-local skills** — skills shipped inside the repository or project being audited (a `skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/` directory, a committed `SKILL.md`, org-provided project skills).
3. **Project tools** — test runners, linters, build scripts, migration tools, connectors, and any binary/script the repository declares (in `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, CI config, `justfile`, etc.). These count as "local tools" even if not packaged as a formal skill.

### Discovery output

Discovery produces a **capability shortlist** — a scored list of `{capability, domain, source, confidence}` entries. This is recorded (in the capability registry or in audit memory) so the audit never rediscovers from scratch and never silently forgets a candidate.

---

## 4. Capability Registry

The registry is the structured inventory of every skill/tool the orchestrator knows about, with metadata that makes selection mechanical rather than guessed.

### What is registered

* Name / identifier
* Source (global skill / project-local skill / project tool / built-in tool / connector)
* Domain of expertise (test execution, security, UI design, spreadsheet, PDF, data analysis, etc.)
* What it is good for (one-line capability)
* Read-only safety (can it run without mutating the project?)
* Change-making capability (is it able to write/edit/deploy?)
* Reputation score (see § 8)
* Declared user mappings (see § 6)
* Last-used / outcome history (derived from audit memory)

### Registry storage

The registry may be:
* **Decorated in memory** — the default: the orchestrator holds it for the session, seeded from discovery, maintained in audit memory JSON.
* **Persisted as a project registry** — an optional `.audit/registry/` store the project owns and reuses across sessions.

The rule: **Global skill = methodology; Project memory = experience.** The registry's persistent, project-specific learning lives in the project's `.audit/` directory, never inside the global skill directory.

### Schema

See `schemas/capability-registry.schema.json`.

---

## 5. Selection Engine

Selection answers: *"For this audit question / this finding, which skill or tool should I use, and why?"*

### Selection modes

The orchestrator supports three selection modes. The mode is chosen by the user (or defaults) and recorded:

| Mode | Behavior | When used |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Automatic** | The engine picks the top-ranked skill/tool per Selection Criteria and proceeds (read-only) or proposes (change-making). | Trusted, established domains; user pre-approved a mode. |
| **User Directed** | The user declares the mapping up front (`skill-mapping.md` / conversation). The mapping always wins. | User has a known preference. |
| **User Approved** | The engine scores candidates, but the final pick is presented to the user for confirmation before it is used (read-only or change-making). | High-stakes, ambiguous, or first-time selections. |

### Selection Criteria (weighed, in order)

1. **User-declared mapping wins.** Check `skill-mapping.md` and the conversation. Honor it without re-deriving criteria.
2. **Domain / file-type match.** Does the artifact match the skill's stated domain? (`.docx` → docx skill; broken formula in `.xlsx` → spreadsheet skill; UI defect → frontend-design skill; security finding → security skill.)
3. **Risk-area match.** Security findings → security-focused instrument; data-integrity findings → differential-verification / data-analysis instrument.
4. **Task-native fit.** Prefer the project's own declared tooling (its test runner, its linter, its build script) over a generic substitute.
5. **Precedent.** A skill/tool already used successfully for a similar issue in this project (from audit memory) beats an unproven substitute.
6. **Reputation.** Prefer higher reputation score (§ 8) when other criteria are equal.
7. **Minimalism.** If the task can be done with what already exists, do not reach for an extra skill/tool. Orchestration is for when a specialist genuinely improves accuracy, evidence quality, or the fix.

### Explainable reason: `WHY THIS SKILL?`

Every non-trivial selection must be expressed as a one-line reason of the form:

> **`WHY THIS SKILL?`** `<capability>` chosen for `<finding/phase>` because `<criterion 1..3 that apply>`; alternatives considered: `<alt1>, <alt2>`; decided by `<mode>`.

### `WHY NOT skill X?`

When a plausible alternative was considered and rejected, record a short **`WHY NOT <X>?`** line stating the decisive reason (weaker domain match, lower reputation, no precedent, change-making when read-only was preferred, etc.). This makes rejections auditable too.

---

## 6. User-Directed Mapping (`skill-mapping.md`)

Optional durable policy file. Create it as soon as the user states a preference, or when two-or-more skills/tools genuinely tie. A declared mapping **always overrides auto-selection** (Selection Criterion 1).

Schema and example are in `references/skill-selection.md`.

---

## 7. Audit Memory (project-side)

Audit memory is the durable, project-scoped store of everything the orchestrator learned and did. It lives in **`.audit/`** in the project being audited — **not** inside the global skill — so it survives across sessions and is visible/editable by the user like the rest of the audit trail.

```
<project>/.audit/
├── memory/
│   ├── capability-registry.json      (optional persisted registry)
│   ├── skill-usage.jsonl             (append-only execution records; supersedes skill-usage-log.md rows)
│   ├── findings.jsonl                (append-only findings with evidence)
│   ├── correlation.json              (finding clusters / X-not-Y records)
│   └── reputation.json               (derived reputation scores)
├── evidence/                         (raw evidence blobs: logs, screenshots, captures)
└── (side-by-side with the existing markdown deliverables)
```

The existing markdown deliverables (`test-audit-task.md`, `audit-plan.md`, `audit-log.md`, `bucket-list.md`, `skill-usage-log.md`, `skill-mapping.md`) continue to be the human-readable view. The `.audit/memory/` JSON/JSONL stores are the machine-readable, queryable view. They must stay in sync.

**Design rule:** *Global skill = methodology; Project memory = experience.* Never write experience into the global skill directory.

---

## 8. Skill Reputation & Confidence

### Reputation score

Each registered skill/tool carries a reputation derived from its history in audit memory:

* **+1** per successful (evidence-producing, no-error) use
* **−1** per failed use (error, wrong result, dropped evidence)
* **0** for a neutral/recorded-but-inconclusive use
* Recent uses weighted higher than old ones (decaying window).

Score is normalized to a printable band: **Low / Medium / High / Trusted**. It informs selection (Criterion 6) and is reported to the user, but never overrides a user-declared mapping.

### Confidence thresholds

Applied to findings and root-cause hypotheses. Findings are never asserted without a confidence label; confidence below `INSUFFICIENT` is not reportable as a finding without more evidence.

| Range | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0–49 | **INSUFFICIENT** | Needs more evidence; not reportable as a confirmed finding |
| 50–69 | **LOW** | Plausible, weakly supported |
| 70–84 | **MEDIUM** | Reasonably supported, some gaps |
| 85–94 | **HIGH** | Strongly supported, reproducible |
| 95–100 | **VERY HIGH** | Directly observed, fully reproducible, independent confirmation |

`CONFIRMED` findings must sit at HIGH or above. `LIKELY` at MEDIUM or above. `SUSPECTED` may be LOW.

---

## 9. Evidence Graph

The evidence graph links **findings → evidence → execution records → files → skills/tools**. It is the traceability backbone: every finding points to the evidence that supports it, the skill/tool invocation that produced that evidence, and the files involved.

A node for a finding carries: id, severity, confidence, root-cause status, evidence references. An evidence reference points to a raw blob or captured output with a producer (skill/tool execution record). An execution record points to the skill/tool and the files touched.

The graph is materialized in `schemas/evidence-graph.schema.json` and written to `.audit/memory/` (or reconstructed from the `.jsonl` stores). It lets the user (or a future audit) answer: *"How do I know this finding is true?"* by walking finding → evidence → execution record → skill/tool → file.

---

## 10. Finding Correlation

The correlation engine groups related findings and records explicit **X-not-Y** relationships.

### Correlation types

* **Same-root-cause cluster:** multiple symptoms trace to one root cause. Cluster id assigned; findings reference it.
* **Duplicate:** same defect reported twice; keep one canonical, note the other.
* **Related-but-distinct:** findings share a surface (same file/feature) but different causes; cross-reference, do not merge.
* **CONFLICTS / CONTRADICTS:** two findings assert incompatible things (e.g. "field is required" vs "field must be optional"). Recorded explicitly with an `X-not-Y` relation pending resolution.
* **BLOCKS / BLOCKED-BY:** ordering dependency between fixes.

### `X-not-Y` record

> Finding `F3` **contradicts** `F2` on the validation rule for `waterCharge`. Both are CONFIRMED at the evidence level; the contradiction is unresolved and **masked** (`MASK: {F2, F3}`) until resolved by the user. No fix proceeds on either until the conflict is resolved.

Correlation output is `schemas/finding-correlation.schema.json` / `correlation.json`.

---

## 11. Read-Only Audit Mode (default)

The default posture is **read-only**: the orchestrator may invoke skills and tools to *inspect, run existing tests, read, search, view, analyze* without asking permission — but every such invocation still produces an execution record, and anything that writes to the project is change-making and gated.

### Read-only (no approval, must log)

* Running existing test/lint/build/typecheck commands
* Static analysis, reading files, inspecting structure
* Searching docs/specs/web for expected behavior
* A skill used purely to read/inspect an artifact (read a `.docx`, check a spreadsheet formula)
* Viewing screenshots to compare expected vs. actual UI

### Change-making (approval required — Gate 2)

* Any skill/tool invocation that writes, edits, generates, or deletes a file in the project
* Any write-capable connector (ticket creation, deployment, migrations, package installs)
* Any skill whose output is meant to directly become the fix

When unsure which bucket an action belongs in, treat it as change-making and ask.

### Child-skill read-only enforcement

Any child skill/tool invoked by the orchestrator is subject to the same read-only default. If a child appears able to mutate the project, the orchestrator must:
1. Confirm the child is being invoked in read-only scope (or that its mutation is explicitly approved via Gate 2).
2. Record the read-only/change-making classification in the execution record.
3. Refuse to let a child mutate the project outside an approved change budget.

---

## 12. Execution Records

Every skill/tool invocation produces an execution record appended to `.audit/memory/skill-usage.jsonl` (and mirrored into `skill-usage-log.md` for human review). Schema in `schemas/skill-execution.schema.json` and `schemas/tool-execution.schema.json`.

Mandatory fields (match the original `skill-usage-log.md` schema, extended):

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | `SU-001`… |
| timestamp | when invoked |
| phase | DISCOVERY / AUDIT / SPECIALIST / ROOT-CAUSE / FIX / VERIFICATION / DEPLOY GATE |
| capability | skill or tool name |
| source | global / project-local / project tool / built-in / connector |
| selection_reason | the `WHY THIS SKILL?` line |
| alternatives_considered | `WHY NOT <X>?` lines |
| selection_mode | Automatic / User Directed / User Approved |
| related_finding | finding id(s) or related issue id |
| purpose | one sentence |
| type | read-only / change-making |
| approval_gate | none (read-only) / pending / gate1_approved / gate2_approved / declined |
| files_touched | files read or modified |
| outcome | evidence produced / fix applied / error |
| reputation_delta | +1 / −1 / 0 |

---

## 13. Dual Approval Gates

### Analysis Approval (Gate 1) — "plan before action"

Present the full `ANALYSIS` block: root cause, confidence, proposed fix, affected files, skill/tool selections with `WHY THIS SKILL?` reasons, change budget, regression risk. Ask: *"Is this analysis and fix plan approved?"* No code changes.

### Code Modification Approval (Gate 2) — "act on the approved plan"

Present the `CODE MODIFICATION` block: the exact files to modify, the change-making skill(s)/tool(s) to invoke (with execution record references), the change budget ("these N files, these M skills/tools, no others"). Ask: *"May I apply this change?"*

Approval semantics:
* "proceed / fix it / yes, apply" after a Gate‑1 block authorizes the **analysis and plan only**. A separate explicit authorization is required to actually modify code (or an explicit combined "analyze and fix it" that grants both).
* Approval covers **exactly** the files and skills/tools named. A different file or a different skill/tool discovered later needs its own Gate‑2 approval.
* If investigation reveals an additional file/skill/tool is required, stop and ask again (change budget).

Simplification for low-risk, user-requested cases: the user may pre-grant "combined" approval ("audit and fix it") that covers both gates at once, but the two-gate structure must still be recorded.

---

## 14. Audit Replay

Because every selection, invocation, finding, correlation, and approval is recorded, the entire audit can be **replayed** — either for the user or in a future session — by walking the `.audit/memory/` stores in order:

1. What was discovered and registered
2. What was selected, and why (`WHY THIS SKILL?`)
3. What was invoked, with what outcome (execution records)
4. What findings were produced, with their evidence and confidence
5. How findings correlate (`X-not-Y`, clusters)
6. What was approved at each gate and what actually changed (audit trail of mutations)

Replay is useful for reviewing an audit after the fact, for on-boarding a fresh session to an in-progress audit, and for regression-style "did we fix what we said we fixed."

---

## 15. Phased Implementation

The upgrade is delivered in 8 phases. Each phase is independently review-able. Fidelity is "full verbatim + references": the core protocol wording is preserved and extended, with deep detail split into `references/`, `schemas/`, and `templates/`.

| Phase | Delivered | Files |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| 1. Discovery | Discovery sources + capability shortlist | `references/skill-discovery.md` |
| 2. Orchestration | Operating modes, registry, selection modes | `SKILL.md`, `references/skill-selection.md`, `references/capability-registry.md` |
| 3. Tool orchestration | Read-only vs change-making for tools, child-skill read-only enforcement | `references/tool-orchestration.md` |
| 4. Memory | `.audit/memory/` JSON/JSONL stores, sync with markdown deliverables | `references/audit-memory.md`, `schemas/*.json` |
| 5. Evidence graph | Findings → evidence → execution records → files link | `references/evidence-and-traceability.md`, `schemas/evidence-graph.schema.json` |
| 6. Correlation | Clusters + `X-not-Y` | `references/finding-correlation.md`, `schemas/finding-correlation.schema.json` |
| 7. Approval | Dual gates (Analysis + Code Modification) | `references/approval-gates.md`, `templates/approval.md` |
| 8. Replay | Walk-through of `.audit/memory/` | `references/audit-replay.md` |

Note: the four protocol references (`audit-documents.md`, `testing-strategies.md`, `root-cause-and-approval.md`, `deployment-gate.md`) remain part of the skill and are extended with cross-references to the new orchestrator references. The original `skill-and-tool-orchestration.md` is superseded and folded into the new split set.

---

## 17. Suggested next steps

1. Read `SKILL.md` and `UPGRADE-PLAN.md` first — they are the constitution and the architecture.
2. Skim the eight `references/` files in phase order (1→8).
3. Try it on a real audit: run DISCOVERY, then AUDIT (read-only), then observe the `WHY THIS SKILL?` reasons, execution records, findings with confidence, correlation, and the two gates.
4. The two most important things to iterate on with real findings: (a) the **dual gate** UX — does Analysis Approval vs Code Modification Approval read clearly? — and (b) the **`WHY THIS SKILL?` / `WHY NOT X?`** reasons — are they enough to let a user approve or redirect confidently?


---

## 18. Status Update — Nested Skill Layer (implemented)

The orchestrator has been extended with a self-contained, config-driven **nested skill**
layer, per the design captured in `references/nested-skill-orchestration.md`. Summary of what
changed and what didn't:

**Unchanged:** the full DISCOVER → TEST → REPRODUCE → DOCUMENT → AUDIT → SELECT SKILLS/TOOLS →
PROPOSE FIX → ANALYSIS APPROVAL → CODE MODIFICATION APPROVAL → EDIT → RE-TEST → REGRESSION →
VERIFICATION → DEPLOY GATE lifecycle, both approval gates, the capability registry, reputation
scoring, evidence graph, finding correlation, and audit memory all work exactly as before.

**Added:**
- `nested-skills.config.json` — drives auto-discovery of `./nested-skills/`. `SKILL.md` has
  zero hard-coded knowledge of which nested skills exist; adding/removing one is a filesystem
  change, not a parent-skill edit.
- `nested-skills/` — one folder per specialist (`SKILL.md` + optional `manifest.json`). See
  `nested-skills/README.md` and `_template-skill/` for the shape to copy.
- A new **Nested Skill Execution Plan** step (`SKILL.md` §4a), inserted into the workflow
  between SELECT SKILLS/TOOLS and PROPOSE FIX: before any nested skill is invoked — read-only
  or change-making — the orchestrator names it, states why it's necessary, lists any scripts
  it may create and why, and lists files it may touch, then waits for approval (or follows an
  existing declared mapping/standing instruction).
- `references/nested-skill-orchestration.md` — the authoritative spec: discovery, manifest
  format, planning, delegation limits (leaf specialists by default, `maxDelegationDepth`),
  resolution priority (user-directed → nested → project-local → external → generic), execution
  records, and the rule that a script proposal is always change-making (Gate 2).
- New schemas: `nested-skills-config.schema.json`, `nested-skill-manifest.schema.json`,
  `nested-skill-plan.schema.json`, `script-plan.schema.json`.
- New templates: `nested-skill-plan.md`, `script-plan.md`.
- `capability-registry.schema.json` and `skill-execution.schema.json` gained a `"nested
  skill"` source value plus nested-skill-specific fields (capabilities, requires_gate_2,
  parent/child selection ids, etc.) — additive, nothing existing was removed.
- New audit-memory logs: `.audit/memory/nested-skill-registry.json` (generated, never
  hand-edited), `nested-skill-selection.jsonl`, `nested-skill-usage.jsonl`,
  `nested-skill-updates.jsonl`, `script-plans.jsonl`.

**Next step:** populate `./nested-skills/` with actual specialists (copy `_template-skill/`
per skill). Until at least one is added, the orchestrator behaves exactly as it did before this
update — the nested-skill layer is inert with an empty directory.


---

## 19. Status Update — Vulnerability Fixes (implemented)

Following a scope/ability review, four concrete gaps were closed:

1. **Honor-system enforcement → mechanical verification.** Added
   `scripts/validate_audit_memory.py` (stdlib-only) and
   `references/verification-and-drift-detection.md`. It checks `.audit/memory/` for id-pattern
   validity, change-making executions missing Gate 2, nested-skill records missing parent/child
   linkage, scripts that reached CREATED without Gate-2 approval, REMOVED scripts with no
   reason, and plan/execution inconsistency. Wired into `deployment-gate.md` §4 as a mandatory,
   blocking check — non-zero exit is a P1+ finding. Smoke-tested against both a deliberately
   broken and a clean synthetic `.audit/memory/` — it catches what it claims to.

2. **No trivial/low-risk fast path → Minimal Ceremony Path.** Added `SKILL.md` §4b: a narrowly
   scoped exception (single file, no logic/security/contract change, no nested skill or
   change-making tool needed) that collapses Gate 1 + Gate 2 into one combined approval block.
   It never skips approval or the execution-record log — only the ceremony shrinks, not the
   safety properties. Anything uncertain defaults back to full ceremony.

3. **Nested-skill overlap resolved but not persisted → persisted mapping.**
   `references/nested-skill-orchestration.md` §5 now requires writing a resolved overlap
   into `skill-mapping.md` as a declared mapping, so the same ambiguity isn't re-asked on the
   next similar finding.

4. **"Never been tested" → `eval/` harness.** Added `eval/README.md` and five scenarios
   (`eval/scenarios/01`–`05`) covering: a trivial change (tests the new fast path doesn't skip
   approval/logging), an ambiguous root cause (tests honest confidence labeling), a nested
   skill actually being planned/approved before invocation, two nested skills tying (tests the
   persisted-mapping fix), and script creation going through the full lifecycle. Each has an
   explicit checklist and fail conditions — run them against fresh sessions and track results
   in the table in `eval/README.md`.

**Known remaining limitation, stated plainly:** the validator checks that what got logged is
internally consistent — it cannot detect an execution that was never logged at all, or a gate
that was shown but not recorded. Real assurance against silent omission still depends on
faithful instruction-following plus a human noticing an unexplained change. This update
narrows that gap; it does not close it completely.
