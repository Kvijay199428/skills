## GATE 2 — CODE MODIFICATION APPROVAL

```
CODE MODIFICATION

Issue ID: F-###
Approved by Analysis Gate 1: <AP-### / confirmation>
Files I will modify now (exactly these N, no others):
  - path/to/file1.ts (reason)
Change-making skill(s)/tool(s) I will invoke now (exactly these M, no others):
  - <capability> (execution record SU-###, approval scope)
Change budget: "I will modify these N files and no others, using these M skill(s)/tool(s) and no others."

CODE MODIFICATION APPROVAL REQUIRED (GATE 2)
```

If no skill/tool beyond direct editing is needed:
```
Change-making skill(s)/tool(s): None — direct edit only.
```

Record each gate decision in `.audit/memory/` as JSON per `schemas/approval.schema.json` (AP-###). A "combined" approval covers both gates but both must be recorded.
